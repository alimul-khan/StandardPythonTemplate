# StandardPythonTemplate

StandardPythonTemplate is a Python project template that provides a basic structure and essential features for building a professional-level project. It includes data preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and result visualization. This template is designed to help you kickstart your Python projects and follow best practices for maintainability and scalability.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Includes a data processing module to load and preprocess data.
- Model creation and training: Provides a model module to create and train a machine learning model.
- Configuration management: Uses a configuration file (config.yaml) to manage various parameters.
- Result visualization: Includes utilities to visualize and save the model evaluation results.
- Unit tests: Includes unit tests for data preprocessing and model creation to ensure the correctness of functions.
- Clean code architecture: Organizes the project into separate modules for better code maintenance.
- README: A detailed README file to guide users on how to set up and use the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or any other preferred machine learning library)
- pandas
- matplotlib
- PyYAML

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alimul-khan/StandardPythonTemplate.git
cd StandardPythonTemplate
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Customize the config/config.yaml file to specify your data paths, model parameters, and training configurations.

Place your data files in the data/ folder or modify the data processing module (data/data_processing.py) to load data from a different location or source.

Implement your machine learning model in the models/model.py file.

Run the main.py script to execute the entire pipeline:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
After running the main.py script, the results will be saved as results.png in the project directory.

## Testing
To run the unit tests, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python -m unittest discover tests
